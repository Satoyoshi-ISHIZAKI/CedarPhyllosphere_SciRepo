# R scripts used for the analysis of phyllosphere microbial communities of *Cryptomeria japonica*, sampled 06/2023
Used for the analysis in "Common garden experiments suggest terpene-mediated associations between phyllosphere microbes and Japanese cedar", [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-16496-2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-16496-2). 
<br>Analysing the amplicon sequencing data on the microbial community in the phyllosphere of *C. japonica* (DDBJ Raw Sequence Archive, PRJDB20421).
<br>Sampling was done in the common gardens at Tsukuba and Kawatabi, Japan, in June 2023.

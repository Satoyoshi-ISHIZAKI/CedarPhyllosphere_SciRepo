# R scripts used for the analysis of phyllosphere microbial communities of *Cryptomeria japonica*, sampled 06/2023
Used for the analysis in "Common garden experiments  suggest terpene-mediated interactions between phyllosphere microbes and *Cryptomeria japonica* populations, with potential influence of its original climates", doi.org/xxxxx (yet to be published). 
<br>Analysing the amplicon sequencing data on the microbial community in the phyllosphere of *C. japonica* (DDBJ Raw Sequence Archive, XXXXXXXXXX).
<br>Sampling was done in the common gardens at Tsukuba and Kawatabi, Japan, in June 2023.
